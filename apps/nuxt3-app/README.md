# Nuxt 3 Minimal Starter

We recommend to look at the [documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org).

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

## Referencing Components

You would reference that button as <BaseButton> as it is constructed from the path segments: Base + Button + Button, with duplicated segments disappearing.

## Development

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
yarn build
```

Checkout the [deployment documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/deployment).
